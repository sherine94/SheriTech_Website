        <p>The First Holographic Smartphone Is Coming Late In 2018   The Future Is Now !
        <br>
        <br>
        AT and Verizon announced  they will start selling a holographic smartphone later this year. The Red Hydrogen One smartphone is the first phone from video equipment company Red.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Android phone's amazing feature is a "holographic display" that projects 3D images that can be viewed without special glasses. You will be able to view the images from the sides and behind, and interact with them using special hand gestures. It will also include cameras for capturing the custom 3D images.
        <br>
        <br>
        Manufacturers continue to add new features -- from waterproofing to animated poop emojis -- to tempt people into upgrading their device. It's unclear if a display that projects images into the air above the phone is just a flashy gimmick or if it will have some practical applications.
        <br>
        <br>
        The phone will be available later this year, as early as the end of the summer, according to AT Neither carrier announced a price for the phone, but during pre-orders, the price range from $1,295 for an aluminum model to $1,595 for a titanium-based option.
